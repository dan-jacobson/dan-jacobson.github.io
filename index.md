# Hello

My name is Dan Jacobson and I'm a machine learning engineer.

I currently work at Lockheed Martin; I'm the tech lead for our AI Consulting Team.

Recently, I've been building our in-house [Foundation Model Platform](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2022/accelerating-artificial-intelligence-ai-at-scale.html), and leading a reinforcement learning team in our [AI for Firefighting](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/firefighting-intelligence.html) portfolio. If you're interested, I presented our work at the [2024 Ray Summit](https://raysummit.anyscale.com/flow/anyscale/raysummit2024/landing/page/sessioncatalog/session/1715727982264001exgd).

I've worked as a diabetes researcher, a biomedical engineer, and a data scientist. I've built products across computer vision, NLP, time series, and RL. Some of them I can talk about. I've shipped linear models, custom transformer architectures, and a lot of CatBoost in between.

To perusing more, find my [full cv](cv), or download a [my resume](assets/files/cv.pdf).

I occationally write about things on [my blog](posts).
