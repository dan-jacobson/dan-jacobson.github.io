# Hello

My name is Dan Jacobson and I'm a machine learning engineer.

I currently work at Lockheed Martin, where I'm the tech lead for our AI Consulting Team.

Recently, I've been building our in-house [Foundation Model Platform](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2022/accelerating-artificial-intelligence-ai-at-scale.html), as well as a reinforcement learning team in our [AI for Firefighting](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/firefighting-intelligence.html) portfolio.

I've worked as a diabetes researcher, a biomedical engineer, and a data scientist. I've built products across computer vision, NLP, time series, and RL. Some of them I can even talk about. I've shipped linear models, custom transformer architectures, and a lot of CatBoost in between.

If you're interested in perusing more, you can find my [full cv](cv), and download a [print version](assets/files/cv.pdf).

You can find things I've written about [on my blog](posts). 

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
