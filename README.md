# dan's portfolio

This is my (dan jacobson) portfolio website. It's designed to be mostly professional, but also a bit fun. I use it to muck around with different tech and silly ideas.

Currently, the website is a Jekyll static site, using the [cvless theme](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) from Michele Piazzai (and others).  


## Installation

Clone the repo locally. The repo depends on `ruby`. If you don't have it, [install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), for example via `brew install ruby` on macOS.

Next, use `bundler` (which should come preinstalled with your ruby version), and run `bundle install` in the project directory.

## Running the site locally

After cloning, and installing dependencies, run the repo with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
